The Spatial and Frequency domain Knowledge Generative Adversarial Networks (SFKGAN) extracts information from the spatial and the frequency domain to take account of the spatial and temporal characteristics in industrial time series. When treating the temporal characteristics, distinctive from many current GANs that almost solely focus on the time or frequency domain, our method takes into account these two domains simultaneously. Our rationale is that the frequency information is better at capturing the inner information and especially the impacts that these faults have on the system, and meanwhile consider the temporal characteristics. As to the spatial characteristic, a special auto-encoder (AE) is adopted to process the correlation among the variables.
